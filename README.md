> "This isn't just a website. It's a statement of what is possible with the modern web."

**CSS3 Mastery** is a next-generation learning platform designed to take developers from "Hello World" to Browser-Engine optimization. Built completely **without frameworks**, this project demonstrates raw, unfiltered mastery of the DOM and CSSOM.

---

## ✨ The "Wow" Factor
This project was engineered to deliver a world-class User Experience (UX) that rivals native applications.

-   **📽️ View Transitions API**: Page navigations **morph** seamlessly. Cards expand into headers, and content flows naturally. No harsh refreshes.
-   **🔮 Holo-Glass Interface**: A bespoke "Neon Glassmorphism" design system built from scratch using CSS Custom Properties and OKLCH color spaces.
-   **🧊 3D Physics Tint**: Cards react to your mouse cursor in real-time using 3D perspective calculations, creating a tactile, physical feel.
-   **🎮 Gamified Learning**: Integrated client-side progress tracking saves your journey automatically, gamifying the education process.
-   **👨‍💻 Live Code Playground**: Don't just read—code. A built-in IDE allows instant manipulation of the DOM directly within the learning modules.

## 🎓 The Curriculum
The content is structured into four distinct academic tiers, covering the absolute cutting edge of the W3C specifications (2024/2025).

| Level | Focus | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Basic** | Foundations | Cascade Layers (`@layer`), Specificity Wars, **Native Nesting** |
| **2. Medium** | Layouts | CSS Grid Level 2 (**Subgrid**), Logical Properties, **:has() Selector** |
| **3. Advanced** | Interaction | **Container Queries**, Scroll-Driven Animations, Trigonometric Functions (`sin/cos`) |
| **4. PhD** | The Engine | Browser Rendering Pipeline, **Houdini Paint API**, Shadow DOM Encapsulation |
| **5. 2025 🔮** | Bleeding Edge | **@scope**, **@starting-style**, **Anchor Positioning**, **color-mix()**, **text-wrap:balance** |

## 🛠️ Engineering Standards
This project serves as a technical showcase for modern frontend practices:

-   **Zero Dependencies**: 100% Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript.
-   **Performance First**: Optimized for 60fps rendering using the composite-only pipeline.
-   **Accessibility (a11y)**: Semantic HTML structure and fluid typography using `clamp()`.
-   **Responsive DNA**: Fluid layouts that adapt to any device, from Watch to 8K Monitor.
